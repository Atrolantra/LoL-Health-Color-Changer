LoL-Health-Color-Changer
========================

A small project that I set myself to apply everything I have learned about Python over the last few weeks of my university course. 
The program is super simple and allows you to change what color your champion's health bar is in the game League of Legends. 
We all know the troubles of playing Katarina and getting lost in a teamfight or the likes but not any more. 

Inspiration for this project is dedicated to this guy.

He wrote his in c though. 

To use this simply download the Python file and run it. You may need to install Python if you don't have it already. 

There are still things I'd like to add and implement and so I'll continue working on it. This also means that if it breaks
and you can't fix it yourself then you can give me a shout. 

Hope you enjoy,

Greets,
